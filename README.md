# Credit Card Fraud Detection with Python

This is Task 3 of my data science internship at CodSoft! I developed a machine learning model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions, focusing on data preprocessing, handling class imbalance with techniques like oversampling and undersampling, and applying classification algorithms such as logistic regression and random forests. I evaluated the model's effectiveness using precision, recall, and F1-score.
